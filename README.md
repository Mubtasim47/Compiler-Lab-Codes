# Compiler Lab Codes

This repository can be helpful if someone is trying to solve compiler design programs. Here all the codes are written in C. Programs implemented here are:

<ul>
  <li>Program to remove space from a source code.</li>
  <li>Program to remove space considering both space and tab bar</li>
  <li>Program to remove line comments</li>
  <li>Program to remove both line and block comments</li>
  <li>Program to recognize a string under the regular expression ab(a|b)*abb</li>
  <li>Program to test whether a given identifier is valid or not</li>
</ul>
